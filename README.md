# Task-4-Setup-and-Use-a-Firewall-on-Linux
Internship at Elevate Labs

---
In this task, I configured and tested firewall rules on my Kali Linux VM using UFW. I started by checking the default firewall settings, then added a rule to block inbound Telnet traffic (port 23) and verified it by attempting a connection, which was successfully blocked. I also added a rule to allow SSH (port 22) to ensure secure remote access, and later removed the Telnet block rule to restore the firewall to its original state. Through this exercise, I learned how UFW manages traffic filtering, how to apply and test specific firewall rules, and how firewall rules play a critical role in securing a system by controlling network access.
